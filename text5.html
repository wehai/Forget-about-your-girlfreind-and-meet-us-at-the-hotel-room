 We were sitting on the bed.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I was on his lefthandside; my arm on his left kneecap. I liked the feeling of the hard bone through the fabric; as if I could go right through it and into the body.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt; text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">I started talking;</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">„I stepped barefoot on a mouse in the garden last night; it teared like a rotten kiwi, slowly squirming still a little damp,</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it was almost certainly pregnant. I took dozens of lives by mistake. I didn‘t just take ones, I prevented lives.“</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt; text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">„So you killed?“</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">„Yes, I killed.“</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt; text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He walked to the window, stood there for a few minutes while I imagined his</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">kneecap from the back.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The kneecap bended and walked to the tabel on the right side of the room</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">where one could get green and black tea and sometimes,</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if it was a decent hotel, which in this nights case we were lucky and got,</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with some fruits and beverages in the small fridge one certainly knows.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some people who might not know these missed out on some decent hotels.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He walked to the table and took one of the knifes, then turned towards me straight with a slight tilt to the right. He layed next to me on the bed, pushed up my blouse</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to the third ripcage and pushed the knife on my skin until it ripped. He tried to cut my ovaries with a knife.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The blade slid into my body, too easy for a knife that wasn‘t supposed to cut flesh but butter.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt; text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Luckily the wrong picture was learnt in class, they were placed lower,</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt; text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">not so high.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: left;">I said: „Stop that‘s ridiculous, that‘s it; he really is dead?“ Glances. He said:</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">„Yes. We‘ve had a month to process it, why can‘t I still.“</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">„Cause you don’t want it to be over.“</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">„I want to destroy all possible life in you. I know, only I am finite; you are the ruler; you are endless; I would have to beat you to infinity until every possibility is over.“</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">He did not raise his voice.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">He was calm and therefore I was as well.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt; text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">No glances. I said:</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">„I would allow it but this will not take away this feeling. Take my possibility of creating new life, I took lives as well, I cannot bear to be a mother anymore.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But you cannot have my lungs, you cannot have my liver, you cannot have my fat.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I idolise getting old. It‘s my god, the rotting, the decay. I die, I like dying. Death is taughed in schools.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But death without decay is unacceptable. I don’t idolise anyone but you.“</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt; text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">I felt the blood flowing out of my body.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was the fountainhead and the floor a new sea to be filled. I stood up (still calmly).</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I walked to the window and looked onto the city which made me love home even more.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rotten is outside and we are escaping in this decent hotel room, how lovely it is to rotten,</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">to die. How sad the fact that Paul is dead.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt; text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He stood next to me, on the lefthandside, both his hand on my stomache filling up the void the knife left in the flesh.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How lovely this city is at night, how lovely it is to be in this decent room, how lovely it is to die.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Everything dies, and everything likes to die.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt; text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We stood there for a period of time I cannot recall. I’ve never spoken of this to anyone.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The time of my first solitude. That happiness,</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">my son’s, is now the happiness of my life.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There was no possible plan to express the amplitude of the misery, since nothing remained of the visible events that had caused it.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt; text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">We later went out to the restaurant of the hotel to eat dinner.</p><p class="s2" style=" text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I held his hand while we were waiting for our glasses of wine. They don’t listen.</p>    <br><br>
